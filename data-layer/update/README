MOOC Dashboard - Course data update
===================================
Originator : Unknown
Last Updated : 1 July 2016 by J.S.Robinson@soton.ac.uk


Overview
--------

This script fetches (meta)data about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) from FutureLearn.com for further processing and presentation by the R/Shiny based web application.
Collection is achieved by a combination of HTML scraping and assembling paths to CSV files.  Reliance on fixed URL paths and the naming of HTML elements makes this script fragile and liable to irreversible breakage without notice. As soon as FutureLearn make an API available, this script should be replaced.

The original author included the facility to export outputs to a MySQL databases (createTable.py, csvToSQL.py).  This facility is currently unused and untested.

Datasets are typically updated by FutureLearn on a daily basis, so this script would typically be run by cron, e.g.

00 00 * * * cd /home/mooc/mooc-dashboard/update/ ; ./update.py >> /tmp/mooc-dashboard-update.log 2>&1 &
